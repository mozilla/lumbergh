Setup
-----
These instructions assume you have [git][], [python][], and `pip` installed. If
you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it with `easy_install pip`.


1. Start by getting the source:

   ```sh
   $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:mozilla/lumbergh.git
   $ cd lumbergh
   ```
   Note you may want to fork and clone the repo as described in the 
   [github docs][git-clone] if you are doing active development.

2. Create a virtualenv for Lumbergh. Skip the first step if you already have
   `virtualenv` installed.

   ```sh
   $ pip install virtualenv
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the compiled requirements:

   ```sh
   $ pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt
   ```   

4. Set up a local MySQL database. The [MySQL Installation Documentation][mysql]
   explains how to do this. Make sure your DB is utf8.

5. Configure your local settings by copying `careers/settings/local.py-dist` to
   `careers/settings/local.py` and customizing the settings in it:

   ```sh
   $ cp settings/local.py-dist settings/local.py
   ```

   The file is commented to explain what each setting does and how to customize
   them.   

   If you wish to have jobs appear locally make sure JOBVITE_URI is set.

6. Initialize your database structure:

   ```sh
   $ python manage.py syncdb
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

```sh
