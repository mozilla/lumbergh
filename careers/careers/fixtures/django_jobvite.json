            "description": "Mozilla is looking for outstanding Masters and PhD level interns to tackle various projects within our Research Group.&nbsp; Past interns have done substantial work in Language Design, Compiler Optimizations and/or Static/Dynamic Analysis. That said, your work will be highly visible and fully Open, just like the rest of Mozilla. We've put together a list of possible research topics for this particular term, but we'd love it if you have research ideas of your own to bring to the group.&nbsp; As always, we strongly encourage our research interns to submit their results to relevant academic conferences. To apply, submit your resume via the online form located below.&nbsp; Be sure to add a line or two a the top of your CV indicating what area of research is most interesting and we'll be back in touch to schedule phone interviews directly. We have limited number of openings so please reach out early if you are interested.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 1: Offline JavaScript Performance Analysis</strong><br /> Modern JavaScript engines make assumptions about the style of code they expect to see. They often assume code is &ldquo;well-structured&rdquo; and \"well-typed\" according to a latent static type system. It can be difficult for programmers to predict whether their code violates the expectations made by optimizing engines. This project would be to develop an offline JavaScript analysis tool that can inform web developers when their programs are likely to fall off the optimized paths of modern engines.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 2: Hygienic Macros for JavaScript</strong><br /> JavaScript standardization is a slow process, and the language only acquires new features every 5 to 10 years. At the same time, the demand for new features from developers is great enough that (<u><a target=\"url\" href=\"http://altjs.org\">http://altjs.org</a>)</u> new languages that compile to JavaScript are constantly being developed. If JavaScript supported macros, programmers could invent new language constructs with new syntax and share them as libraries. This project would be to design and prototype a hygienic macro system for JavaScript.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 3: Parallel HTML Parser</strong><br /> Browsers do not currently take advantage of hardware parallelism as much as they could. The parsing algorithms in Firefox are currently entirely sequential. This project would be to design and implement a parallel HTML parser.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 4: Parallel CSS Processing</strong><br /> There are many opportunities for parallel processing of CSS. This project would be to parallelize CSS selector matching and rule processing.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 5: Power-efficient Video Decoding</strong><br /> Firefox ships with video decoders written for the CPU, using SIMD extensions where available. These decoders are known to have poor power consumption. This project would be to implement a tuned video decoder using programmable GPU's via OpenGL and to compare the performance and power consumption against that of tuned CPU+SIMD decoders and hardware-specialized decoders.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 6:Power-efficient Voice Recognition</strong><br /> Many accessibility systems use voice recognition as a primary user input mechanism, and voice recognition is becoming more prevalent as a viable form of user input for mobile devices. High quality voice recognition can be implemented via server-side processing, but in-device recognition is a bigger challenge. This project would be to develop a high-quality voice recognition system that can run on mobile devices by exploiting parallel hardware.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 7: Static Analysis of the Browser Event Model</strong><br /> Doctor JS (<a target=\"url\" href=\"http://doctorjs.org\">http://doctorjs.org</a>) is a static analysis framework for JavaScript built on an advanced abstract interpreter for the JavaScript semantics. However, the engine currently knows very little about the non-deterministic control-flow and data-flow model of browser events and user-defined event handlers. This project would be to adapt DoctorJS to understand the browser's event model.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 8: </strong><strong>XPCOM Interface Extraction</strong><br /> Part of the challenge of building analysis and development tools for the browser infrastructure is the interface between JavaScript (used to implement the Firefox user interface as well as browser extensions) and C++ (used to implement the core platform). The Gecko platform uses a component model, known as XPCOM, for implementing these cross-language interfaces. Firefox uses about 1,500 distinct XPCOM interfaces -- too many to model by hand in a static analysis framework. This project would be to use C++ static analysis tools such as\u3000Dehydra (<a target=\"url\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Dehydra\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Dehydra</a>) to generate interface descriptors that could be integrated into a static analysis for JavaScript.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 9: A Rust Debugger</strong><br /> Rust (<a target=\"url\" href=\"http://rust-lang.org\">http://rust-lang.org</a>) is a next-generation parallel systems language being designed and implemented at Mozilla Research. Rust's shared-nothing concurrency model should make it possible to combine traditional sequential debugging techniques (e.g., gdb) with novel concurrent debugging technology. This project would be to develop a Rust debugger.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Project 10: Asynchronous I/O for Rust</strong><br /> The libuv (<a target=\"url\" href=\"https://github.com/joyent/libuv\">https://github.com/joyent/libuv</a>) project is developing a cross-platform systems library for asynchronous I/O. This project would be to design and implement an asynchronous I/O library and infrastructure for Rust.<br />&nbsp;"
