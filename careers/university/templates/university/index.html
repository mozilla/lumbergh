        Mozilla isn’t just a great place to intern. It’s an experience you’ll carry with you throughout your career.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the people you’ll meet and collaborate with — a passionate global community of technologists, thinkers and builders — to the opportunities you’ll have to learn and make the Web a better place, it’s safe to say your internship with Mozilla will be unlike any other.

        <h3><strong>When</strong> should I apply?</h3>
        <p>
          We begin accepting internship applications in September and are typically finished recruiting for the calendar year by the end of April. While there is no set application deadline, we have a limited number of positions open each year, so apply early! All open positions are posted on our listings page.

      <div class="know-box">
        <h3><strong>What</strong> is the interview process like?</h3>
        <p>
          Our interview process is pretty straightforward. You can expect to have 3&ndash;5 technical interviews with live coding questions, usually done via Skype. We think our interviewers are pretty tough, but the students who make it through usually tell us they had fun. Weird? Maybe. But at Mozilla, weird is normal.

        <h3><strong>Will</strong> I get paid?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! We offer a competitive stipend in addition to housing, immigration and relocation assistance. And of course, lots of swag!
