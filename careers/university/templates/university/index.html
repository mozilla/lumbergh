        Mozilla isn’t just a great place to intern. It’s an experience you’ll carry with you throughout your career.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the people you’ll meet and collaborate with — a passionate global community of technologists, thinkers and builders — to the opportunities you’ll have to learn and make the Web a better place, it’s safe to say your internship with Mozilla will be unlike any other.
